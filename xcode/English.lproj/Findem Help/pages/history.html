				<h1>How Findem' came about</h1>
			</div><br /><br />
			<h2>A problem of all music collections</h2>
			<p>Importing my music into iTunes, I found many things that bugged me about my music.  Missing ID3 information, missing album art, and missing lyrics.  I quickly found out that finding lyrics is a pain in the ass; and even moreso for collection of music. The songs, even when copied from the CD's to your computer, or even the iTunes music store, do not automagically import lyrics. I decided that this is simply unacceptable.</p>
			<h2>Findem is born: Version 1.suck</h2>
			<p>I wrote the original Findem script (applescript interface, and a php-based backend) to automagically find lyrics and insert them (with copyright information, when possible) into your ID3 tags of your mp3's.  This was Findem' version 1.0, and although rather successful, it didn't really have all the things I wanted in my application.  It was slow, you couldn't edit results, and more often than not you would have to go back into the lyrics VIA iTunes and fix minor things, and different lyrics results for the same songs on different albums.  This annoyed me, and wasn't scalable to the number of songs I have; and generally sucked more than it was helpful.</p>
			
			<h2>Findem 2.0: out of the ashes (sorta)</h2>
			<p>I decided to scrape the backend, and completely re-write the front-end; in actuality, findem 2.0 is a complete re-write of the original, with absolutely no source shared between the two (although, they are kept in the same repository because it is the same app).  I re-wrote the frontend to handle text editing and auto formatting; as well as individual lyrical lookups on the songs with similiar names.  I re-wrote the backend to use one reliable lyrical source, and wrote a easy-to-expand formatting engine that uses mapping dictionaries to fix 99% of the common mistakes from people who put lyrics up on the web.</p>
			<p>A week later, Findem 2.0 was born; with another two weeks used to put on the shine for the applicaiton (including learning how to do help manuals, integration of scripts into the application file, and other general awesomeness).</p>
			<h2>For you, music lovers</h2>
			<p>I offer this program as Donationware, for those who share the same passion of music that I do.  Music is the most powerful form on earth: it can move us, make us angry, comfort us when we are sad, make us excited, and much more.  I ask that you all spread the joy and passion of music within yourself -- it is the one thing, across all languages and cultures, is what binds us all to humanity.</p>
