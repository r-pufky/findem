			<h2>This is NOT Apple!</h2>
			<p>AT NO TIME SHOULD APPLE BE CONSIDERED THE AUTHOR OR OWNER OF THIS PRODUCT, NOR SHOULD THERE BE ANY AFFILIATION BETWEEN APPLE AND THIS AUTHOR.  At the request of any Apple, Inc. representative, I will remove any content that is deemed "infringing" upon their rights.</p>
			<h2>Retrieval of lyrics from the web</h2>
			<p>It remains to be proven in court whether it is LEGAL to take lyrics from the web and insert them into your songs, without paying the owner of the song for their work (however asinine this may seem).  I personally believe that if you paid for the song, you should be able to read the lyrics as well; however, some bands will freely distribute lyrics, while others will not.  As I have no control over what YOU DO with this program, I cannot ENSURE that you WILL NOT BE BREAKING THE LAW.  IN SUCH CASES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR USING THIS PROGRAM.  I CANNOT AND WILL NOT STOP YOU FROM BEING AN IDIOT.  AT THE REQUEST OF ANY LEGAL ENTITY, I WILL REMOVE THE 'SEARCH' FUNCTIONALITY FOR THE LYRICS FROM THIS PROGRAM.  I AM NOT LIABLE FOR WHAT YOU DO.</p>
